# website-traffic-analysis
checking the traffic of different means of data from different parameters from the dataset

you can run in command prompt as
streamlit run D://..project//streamli.py [ARGUMENTS]

With these modifications:

We adjusted the colorscale to use red for negative correlation, blue for positive correlation, which is more intuitive.
Text annotations directly indicate the correlation values in each cell of the heatmap.
The color of the text adjusts based on the strength of the correlation: white for strong correlations (|r| > 0.5) and black for weaker correlations.
These changes should provide a more user-friendly and informative correlation plot.

x-axis ,y-axis info:
Certainly! In the context of the line graph displayed for each selected parameter, the x-axis and y-axis values have specific meanings:
1. **X-axis Values**: The x-axis typically represents the independent variable or the parameter that is being measured or observed over time or another continuous scale. In the line graph, each point on the x-axis corresponds to a specific value of the independent variable. For example, if you're analyzing website traffic data over time, the x-axis values might represent different time intervals (e.g., days, weeks, months).
2. **Y-axis Values**: The y-axis represents the dependent variable or the parameter that is being measured or observed in response to changes in the independent variable. In the line graph, each point on the y-axis corresponds to a specific value of the dependent variable. For example, if you're analyzing website traffic data, the y-axis values might represent the number of visits or the bounce rate.
When you select parameters to visualize in the line graph, the x-axis and y-axis values are determined based on the columns you select. For example:
- If you select "Time" as the x-axis parameter and "Number of Visits" as the y-axis parameter, the x-axis values will represent different time intervals (e.g., days) and the y-axis values will represent the number of visits corresponding to each time interval.
- If you select "Date" as the x-axis parameter and "Bounce Rate" as the y-axis parameter, the x-axis values will represent different dates and the y-axis values will represent the bounce rate corresponding to each date.
The x-axis and y-axis values provide context and interpretation for the data displayed in the line graph, helping users understand the relationship between the selected parameters and how they change over time or another continuous scale.
